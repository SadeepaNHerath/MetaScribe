## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

- `client/` - Frontend React application
- `server/` - Backend Node.js API (for local development)
- `api/` - Serverless API functions for Vercel deployment
- `shared/` - Shared types and schemas

## üö¶ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or later
- npm or yarn
- PostgreSQL 16 (for future database implementation)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SadeepaNHerath/MetaScribe
   cd MetaScribe
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables (create a `.env` file)

### Database Setup

**Current Implementation**: The application currently uses in-memory storage which requires no additional setup. All data will be lost when the server restarts.

**Future PostgreSQL Implementation**: 
1. Create a PostgreSQL database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE metascribe;
   ```

2. Configure database connection in your `.env` file:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/metascribe
   ```

3. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   npm run migrate
   ```

### Running the Application

- For development:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- For production:
  ```bash
  npm run build
  npm run start
  ```

- For client-only development:
  ```bash
  npm run dev:client
  ```

- For server-only development:
  ```bash
  npm run dev:server
  ```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

## üåê Deployment

### Vercel Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel with serverless API functions.

1. Make sure your Vercel account is set up and connected to your GitHub repository
2. Deploy using the Vercel CLI or GitHub integration:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. The deployment uses:
   - Static site hosting for the React frontend
   - Serverless functions for the API endpoints

### API Architecture

- **Local Development**: Uses Express server in `server/` directory
- **Production**: Uses serverless functions in `api/` directory
- **Storage**: Currently in-memory (non-persistent in production)
- **Routes**: Main endpoint is `/api/analyze` for SEO analysis
